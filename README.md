# Optimal-Tyre-Management
## Overview

The Optimal Tyre Management tool is a powerful simulation framework designed to help motorsport teams determine the best strategies for tyre usage over a race. By analysing parameters such as tyre wear, grip levels, and pit stop timings, this tool provides actionable insights to maximise performance and minimise tyre degradation.

## Features

- **Pit Stop Optimisation**: Suggests optimal pit stop strategies based on tyre degradation and lap times.
- **Dynamic Wear Modelling**: Simulates tyre wear and its impact on lap performance.
- **Multi-Compound Analysis**: Compares strategies across different tyre compounds.
- **Environmental Factors**: Adjusts predictions based on track temperature, load, and weather conditions.
- **Real-Time Adjustment**: Provides updates based on changing race scenarios.
